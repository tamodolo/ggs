generic game selector came to solve my problem of choosing the next game to play after
finishing the current. Normaly I take some weeks of nothingness until select one and as
my library grows out of control nowadays the necessity to choose the next game a little
faster came. 

FAQ

Q. what you need to run this program?

R. You will need Python 3.x to actualy run the code and pyQT 5.x for the GUI

Q. can I run this without the GUI?

R. No. This is a early development program so there are no plans for that

Q. How it works?

R. There is a button and a label in front of it. The button opens a .txt file that you have
to point at. The .txt must have one item per line. When you pick the file and click OK, the
program will chose one item from the list and will show it to you in the label.

Q. There will be complex features like selecting by category or by plataform?

R. Yes. Eventually... help needed!
